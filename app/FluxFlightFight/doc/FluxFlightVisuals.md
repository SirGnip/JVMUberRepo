# Brainstorm of visual looks

- all (mostly?) horizontal, glowing lines


# Technical details for visual effects

### Experiments with glowing lines:

Got very nice glow effect by drawing a line with:
- width 5
- alpha .8
- color blue
- effect Glow(1.0)

...then drawing the same line on top with:
- width 2
- alpha .8
- color BLUE (BLUE felt like a beam, changing color to SKYBLUE made a dramatic, electric look)
- NO Glow
