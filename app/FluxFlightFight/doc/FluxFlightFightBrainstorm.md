# FluxFight

### Brainstorm

glow based joust for 4+ people."flux fight" "juxta-fight" "Lance-a-lot" (name already taken)
geometric graphic sensibility. glow on nearly everything. use non-glow to draw attention to stuff. 4
players minimum. have a bunch of different round types (physics changes, rate of falling,
different level layouts). have other objectives for "egg wave" (stunt flying, speed runs of a
course, survival, pickup micro-quests). visual themes: electricity, lasers, sparks. for design of
characters, think about the old x-pilot way of being able to define your own ship. ascii or
excel-based level design? Can I get the boys involved somehow? let them design levels? Does a
"level" specify the "physics" (gravity strength, flap strength, forward motion?)? Or, does the
game mix physics with game level together some other way?  Hwo do I differentiate the visuals
from Geometry Wars? Limited color palette? Keep black and white and gray, except for the parts
that I want to highlight (player colors). Can I change the angle of motion blur with a property
so I can dynamically drive the direction of the motion blur? Box blur looks pretty good, if not
better than Glow.

### Game ideas

##### Game Modes
- deathmatch
- last man standing
- team deathmath
- capture the flag
- some kind of area-control mechanic? 
- point control (every second your team owns a marker, you get a point)
- hide and seek. everyone but "hider" turns away from screen. player chooses spot. screen fades out, comes back. everyone turns around and tries to find player
    - what does "hiding" player do?
- make something for single player
    - single player in level with robots?  any scoring?
    - different modes where you go for high score? distance? survival times?
    - there are solo player achievements (speed runs, survival time, points, etc) that are recorded w/ a "login" and single players can see their list of achievements
- Moth (one on many trying to see how long the solo weak player day last)
- capture the flag
- "art" mode where your player launches effects (streamers, fireworks, glow, sparkles) and you can create visuals with other players
- fetch quests
- Different areas highlight on screen and everyone needs to get there fast. Then area changes (think of the demolition derby game)
- Race through checkpoints (ordered, but not everyone hits the same one at same time? People start at diff places in the sequence.). Doesn't have to be a circle. Can be crossing and double back.
- Birds dropping bombs in a bomb dropping game (trying to hit targets that aren't other players. Maybe NPCs?)
- Chase. Two birds start on opposite ends of a cycle of checkpoints. They have to chase each other down (path could cross?)

##### Game Mechanics
- have some trigger on the bottom of the screen that drops rocks from the top of the screen
- have rocks that birds can pick up, carry, and then drop on players. rocks will naturally fall towards bottom of screen, which means players have to carry them to the top where the rocks are more useful. a nice player "flow".
    - rocks have many uses "collection", "delivery", "weapon", "target practice", "hit trigger box"
- could create a "plinko" game with picking up rocks and dropping them and trrying to get them into baskets, or certain areas. Rocks would be "bombs" where they would take on some horizontal momentum
- have a "glide" mechanic where if you hold your button, you can't flap, but you will glide down. To what advantage? How do you control with the two buttons left? add another button?
- Portals for teleportin
- chain of baby birds that follow you (sffect would be nice of this undulating trail that follows you) that you need to collect from other players. They follow behind you in a line that follow in a line your moves. When you bite the end of the tail, you steal a baby bird.
- Gravity changers (up, down, sides)
    - Circular gravity. Flapping propells you away from center.
- forces
    - Wind
    - Black holes
- Traps that make you slower
- Mode toggling that make your player slow and heavy and big or small and fast.

##### Game theme/visuals
- bird
- flying dinosaurs
- paper airplanes
- quadcopters/drones
