# JavaFX uberrepo

# thoughts
do an uber repo for my JavaFX code (games and UI utils). But, acknowledge that the repo may contain some sub artifacts that could be used by other code external to the uber repo (if I write generic Java string utils, have things structured that I could build a .jar of just the string utils instead of the whole JavaFX uber-repo.  Just because everything is in the uber-repo doesnâ€™t mean it has to be distributed that way.
