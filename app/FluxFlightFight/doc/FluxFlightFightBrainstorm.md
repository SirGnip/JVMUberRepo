# FluxFight

### Brainstorm

glow based joust for 4+ people."flux fight" "juxta-fight" "Lance-a-lot" (name already taken)
geometric graphic sensibility. glow on nearly everything. use non-glow to draw attention to stuff. 4
players minimum. have a bunch of different round types (physics changes, rate of falling,
different level layouts). have other objectives for "egg wave" (stunt flying, speed runs of a
course, survival, pickup micro-quests). visual themes: electricity, lasers, sparks. for design of
characters, think about the old x-pilot way of being able to define your own ship. ascii or
excel-based level design? Can I get the boys involved somehow? let them design levels? Does a
"level" specify the "physics" (gravity strength, flap strength, forward motion?)? Or, does the
game mix physics with game level together some other way?  Hwo do I differentiate the visuals
from Geometry Wars? Limited color palette? Keep black and white and gray, except for the parts
that I want to highlight (player colors). Can I change the angle of motion blur with a property
so I can dynamically drive the direction of the motion blur? Box blur looks pretty good, if not
better than Glow.
